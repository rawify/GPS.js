GPS.js is an extensible parser for [NMEA](http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm) sentences, given by any common GPS receiver. The output is tried to be as high-level as possible to make it more useful than simply splitting the information. The aim is, that you don't have to understand NMEA, just plug in your receiver and you're ready to go.


## Usage


The interface of GPS.js is as simple as the following few lines. You need to add an event-listener for the completion of the task and invoke the update method with a sentence you want to process. There are much more examples in the examples folder.

```javascript
const gps = new GPS;

// Add an event listener on all protocols
gps.on('data', parsed => {
    console.log(parsed);
});

// Call the update routine directly with a NMEA sentence, which would
// come from the serial port or stream-reader normally
gps.update("$GPGGA,224900.000,4832.3762,N,00903.5393,E,1,04,7.8,498.6,M,48.0,M,,0000*5E");
```

It's also possible to add event-listeners only on one of the following protocols, by stating `gps.on('GGA', ...)` for example.

## State


The real advantage over other NMEA implementations is, that the GPS information is interpreted and normalized. The most high-level API is the state object, which changes with every new event. You can use this information with:

```javascript
gps.on('data', () => {
  console.log(gps.state);
});
```

## Installation

Installing GPS.js is as easy as cloning this repo or use the following command:

```
npm install gps
```

## Find the serial device


On Linux serial devices typically have names like `/dev/ttyS1`, on OSX `/dev/tty.usbmodem1411` after installing a USB to serial driver and on Windows, you're probably fine by using the highest COM device you can find in the device manager. Please note that if you have multiple USB ports on your computer and use them randomly, you have to lookup the path/device again.

## Examples


GPS.js comes with some examples, like drawing the current latitude and longitude to Google Maps, displaying a persistent state and displaying the parsed raw data. In some cases you have to adjust the serial path to your own GPS receiver to make it work.

Simple serial example
---

```javascript
const SerialPort = require('serialport');
const GPS = require('gps');

const port = new SerialPort('/dev/tty.usbmodem11401', { // change path
  baudRate: 9600,
  parser: new SerialPort.parsers.Readline({
    delimiter: '\r\n'
  })
});

const gps = new GPS;

gps.on('data', data => {
  console.log(data, gps.state);
})

port.on('data', data => {
  gps.updatePartial(data);
})
```

Dashboard
---
Go into the folder `examples/dashboard` and start the server with

```
node server
```

After that you can open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000. The result should look like the following, which in principle is just a visualization of the state object `gps.state`

Google Maps
---
Go into the folder `examples/maps` and start the server with

```
node server
```

After that you can open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000 The result should look like

Confluence
---
[Confluence](http://www.confluence.org/) is a project, which tries to travel to and document all integer GPS coordinates. GPS.js can assist on that goal. Go into the examples folder and run:

```
node confluence
```

You should see something like the following, updating as you move around

```
You are at (48.53, 9.05951),
The closest confluence point (49, 9) is in 51.36 km.
You have to go 355.2Â° N
```

Set Time
---
On systems without a RTC - like Raspberry PI - you need to update the time yourself at runtime. If the device has an internet connection, it's quite easy to use an NTP server. An alternative for disconnected projects with access to a GPS receiver can be the high-precision time signal, sent by satellites. Go to the examples folder and run the following to update the time:

```
node set-date
```

## Available Methods


update(line)
---
The update method is the most important function, it parses a NMEA sentence and forces the callbacks to trigger

updatePartial(chunk)
---
Will call `update()` when a full NMEA sentence has been arrived

on(event, callback)
---
Adds an event listener for a protocol to occur (see implemented protocols, simply use the name - upper case) or for all sentences with `data`. Because GPS.js should be more general, it doesn't inherit `EventEmitter`, but simply invokes the callback.

off(event)
---
Removes an event listener

## Implemented Protocols

## GPS State

If the streaming API is not needed, but a solid state of the system, the `gps.state` object can be used. It has the following properties:

- time: Current time
- lat: Latitude
- lon: Longitude
- alt: Altitude
- satsActive: Array of active satellites
- speed: Speed over ground in km/h
- track: Track in degrees
- satsVisible: Array of all visible satellites

Adding new protocols is a matter of minutes. If you need a protocol which isn't implemented, I'm happy to see a pull request or a new ticket.


## Troubleshooting

If you don't get valid position information after turning on the receiver, chances are high you simply have to wait as it takes some [time to first fix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_fix).

## Functions


GPS.js comes with a few static functions, which helps working with geo-coordinates.

GPS.Parse(line)
---
Parses a single line and returns the resulting object, in case the callback system isn't needed/wanted

GPS.Distance(latFrom, lonFrom, latTo, lonTo)
---
Calculates the distance between two geo-coordinates using Haversine formula

GPS.TotalDistance(points)
---
Calculates the length of a traveled route, given as an array of {lat: x, lon: y} point objects

GPS.Heading(latFrom, lonFrom, latTo, lonTo)
---
Calculates the angle from one coordinate to another. Heading is represented as windrose coordinates (N=0, E=90, S=189, W=270). The result can be used as the argument of [angles](https://github.com/infusion/Angles.js) `compass()` method:

```javascript
const angles = require('angles');
console.log(angles.compass(GPS.Heading(50, 10, 51, 9))); // will return x â { N, S, E, W, NE, ... }
```


## Using GPS.js with the browser

The use cases should be rare to parse NMEA directly inside the browser, but it works too.

```html
<script src="gps.min.js"></script>
<script>
   var gps = new GPS;
   gps.update('...');
</script>
```

## Building the library

After cloning the Git repository run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Run a test

Testing the source against the shipped test suite is as easy as

```
npm run test
```
